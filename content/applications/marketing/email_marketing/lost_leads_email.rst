Lost leads reactivation email
=============================

In Odoo, lost leads are removed from the active *CRM* pipeline, but can still be targeted with the
*Email Marketing* application for strategic campaign purposes, such as lost leads reactivation.

A lost leads reactivation email looks at the leads that were lost during a specific period of time,
and uses custom filters and lost reasons to exclude undesirable leads from the mailing list.

Once a lost leads reactivation email is complete, it can be sent as is, modified and sent to
different groups for A/B testing, or saved as a template for later.

.. example::
   A warehouse has leftover merchandise from a limited run of items from last year. To help clear
   out the excess inventory, the warehouse manager creates a lost leads email to reach out to old
   opportunities that were lost, and inform them that the limited merchandise is back in stock.

   The warehouse manager uses the following filters for a lost leads email:

   - :guilabel:`Blacklist` *is* `not set`
   - :guilabel:`Created on` *>=* `01/01/2024 00:00:01`
   - :guilabel:`Stage` *is not in* `New`, `Qualified`, or `Won`
   - :guilabel:`Lost Reason` *is in* `Not enough stock`
   - and either :guilabel:`Active` *is* `set` or `not set`

.. tip::
   As filters are added and removed, pay attention to the :guilabel:`# record(s)` value below the
   filtering section. This value indicates the total number of records that match the current
   criteria.

   To view a list of all matching records, click the :guilabel:`# record(s)` text.

Minimum requirements
====================

In order to create and deliver a lost leads reactivation email campaign, the *CRM* and *Email
Marketing* applications **must** be :ref:`installed <general/install>` and configured.

Here are the minimum necessary filters that pertain to a lost leads reactivation mailing campaign:

- The :ref:`Recipients <email_marketing/recipients_field>` field **must** be set to the
  *Lead/Opportunity* model.
- A :ref:`Blacklist <email_marketing/blacklist_filter>` filter to exclude unsubscribed recipients.
- A :ref:`Created on <email_marketing/created_on_filter>` to target leads that were lost during a
  specific period of time.
- :ref:`Stage <email_marketing/stage_filter>` filter(s) to exclude leads that were already won, or
  are still active in new stages of the sales pipeline (i.e. *New*, *Qualified*, etc.). These values
  will be different per organization; however, it's minimally viable to exclude all the leads in the
  *Won* stage.
- One or more :ref:`Lost Reason <email_marketing/lost_reason_filter>` filters to exclude undesired
  leads, such as duplicate, spam, or irrelevant records.
- A pair of :ref:`Active <email_marketing/active_filter>` filters to target *both* active and
  inactive leads.

Add the necessary filters
=========================

First, navigate to the :menuselection:`Email Marketing` app, and on the :guilabel:`Mailings` page,
click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner.

.. _email_marketing/recipients_field:

On the new :guilabel:`Mailings` form, enter an appropriate :guilabel:`Subject` line for the email in
the corresponding field. Then, in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, choose the
:guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity` model from the drop-down menu.

.. _email_marketing/blacklist_filter:

In the rules section, located beneath the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, click the modify filter
(:guilabel:`▶ (triangle pointing right)`) icon to expand the filter rules. Leave the default
:guilabel:`Blacklist` rule in place.

.. _email_marketing/created_on_filter:

Created on
----------

Begin by clicking :guilabel:`New Rule` beneath the default :guilabel:`Blacklist` rule. Then, click
the first field of the new rule that appears, and select the :guilabel:`Created on` parameter from
the drop-down menu. With that in place, a specific time period during which the targeted leads were
lost can be designated (e.g. 30 days prior, 90 days prior, previous year, etc.).

Then, in the second field, select :guilabel:`<= (less than or equal to)`, :guilabel:`>= (greater
than or equal to)`, or :guilabel:`is between` as a date operator, in order to frame the time
selection chosen in the third field.

In the third field, use the calendar popover window to select dates, and click :guilabel:`Apply` to
lock in the time range.

.. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-created-on
   :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
   :shows: A filter rule on the Created on field using the <= operator with a date value.
   :highlight: The Created on rule (red frame).
   :data: Created on <= 01/01/2026.
   :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
   :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

.. important::
   When there is more than one rule applied, make sure the statement at the top of the
   :guilabel:`Recipients` filter list reads: :guilabel:`Match all of the following rules`. If it
   does not, click on the statement, and select :guilabel:`all` from the drop-down menu (as opposed
   to :guilabel:`any`).

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-match-all
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
      :shows: The 'Match all of the following rules' statement above the rule list with its drop-down menu open on 'any of'.
      :highlight: The drop-down menu (red frame).
      :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
      :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

.. _email_marketing/stage_filter:

Stage
-----

Now, add the :guilabel:`Stage` filter to exclude leads that are in the *New*, *Qualified*, and *Won*
stages of the sales pipeline.

.. note::
   This step assumes that the *New*, *Qualified*, and *Won* stages exist in the CRM pipeline;
   however, stage names may differ from business to business. Refer to the database's actual stage
   names in the *CRM* app's pipeline to complete this step, accordingly.

Begin again by clicking :guilabel:`New Rule` and select :guilabel:`Stage` from the first field's
drop-down menu. In the second field, select the :guilabel:`is not in` operator, and in the third
field, select the :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Qualified` and :guilabel:`Won` stages to define the
rule's parameters.

When the rule is added in this way, the logic in the third field renders as :code:`OR` (`|`)
statements.

.. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-stage-is-in
   :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
   :shows: A single filter rule on Stage using the 'is not in' operator with several stages selected.
   :highlight: The operator and value of the Stage rule (red frame).
   :data: Stages 'New', 'Qualified' and 'Won' selected.
   :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
   :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

.. tip::
   Another way to add *Stage* rules, is to do so on a one-rule-per-row basis using the
   :guilabel:`contains` or :guilabel:`does not contain` operators, and manually typing out the
   defining characters in each stage name. This method, however, only allows for one selection at a
   time, which can be useful for quickly turning on/off filters in the :guilabel:`Search...` bar.

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-stages
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
      :shows: Three separate filter rules requiring that Stage does not contain New, Qualified or Won.
      :highlight: The three Stage rules (red frame).
      :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
      :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

.. _email_marketing/lost_reason_filter:

Lost Reason
-----------

Next, add one or more :guilabel:`Lost Reason` rules to exclude leads that should **not** be targeted
for specific :doc:`lost reasons <../../sales/crm/pipeline/lost_opportunities>`.

To do that, create another :guilabel:`New Rule`, once again. Then, in the rule's first field, select
:guilabel:`Lost Reason` from the drop-down menu. For the operator, choose either :guilabel:`is not
in` or :guilabel:`does not contain` from the drop-down menu. With either selection, use the third
field to enter a lost reason (or multiple lost reasons, depending on your operator choice) to
include in the rule.

If choosing the :guilabel:`does not contain` operator, then repeat the preceding steps to add more
lost reasons, as needed, where each lost reason occupies one rule row at a time.

For more information, refer to the section below outlining how to :ref:`select appropriate lost
reasons <email_marketing/select_lost_reasons>`.

.. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-reasons
   :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
   :shows: A group of filter rules that exclude every lost reason except the targeted one.
   :highlight: The lost reason rules (red frame).
   :data: Lost reasons 'Too expensive', 'Out of stock', 'Not enough stock'.
   :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
   :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

.. _email_marketing/active_filter:

Active
------

Finally, add a pair of :guilabel:`Active` filters to include both active and inactive leads for the
campaign.

.. important::
   Adding both active *and* inactive lead records is necessary to capture the full scope of lost
   leads in the database. Doing one without the other greatly impacts the number of targetable
   records for the email campaign, and does **not** include a complete or accurate lost leads
   audience.

First, click the :guilabel:`(Add Branch)` icon on the most recently created rule (e.g.
:guilabel:`Lost Reason`), which is the middle of three icons located to the right of the rule row.
Doing so adds a pair of :guilabel:`any of` rules. Then, in the top rule's first field of the
newly-created branch, select the :guilabel:`Active` parameter from the drop-down menu. The rule then
automatically fills out to read: :guilabel:`Active` *is* `set`.

For the first field of the bottom rule of the branch, select :guilabel:`Active` from the drop-down
menu again. However, this time, select :guilabel:`is not` from the operator drop-down menu in the
second field. The rule should then read: :guilabel:`Active` *is not* `set`.

.. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-active
   :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
   :shows: A pair of 'any of' filter rules on the Active field, so that both active and archived (lost) leads are included.
   :highlight: The two Active rules and the 'any of' statement (red frame).
   :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
   :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

Add body content
================

Now, with the domain section of the email campaign complete, create the body content of the email
using any of the premade stylized templates, or choose between the :guilabel:`Plain Text` or
:guilabel:`Start From Scratch` options for more granular control. For more information, refer to the
*Email Marketing* :ref:`documentation on how to create an email <email_marketing/create_email>`.

.. tip::
   To save the set of filters for later use, click :guilabel:`Save as Favorite Filter 💾 (floppy
   disk)`, enter a name (such as `Lost Leads`), and click :guilabel:`Add`.

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-favorite-filter
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
      :shows: The Save as Favorite Filter pop-up window with a name entered for the lost-leads criteria.
      :highlight: The name field (red frame).
      :data: Filter name 'Lost leads'.
      :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
      :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

Send or schedule
================

Once all the components of the email campaign are complete, either:

- click the purple :guilabel:`Send` button at the top-left of the form to immediately send the
  email; or
- click the gray :guilabel:`Schedule` button, located to the right of the :guilabel:`Send` button,
  to send the email at a future date and time.

.. tip::
   Consider using *A/B Testing* to send an alternate version of the email to a percentage of the
   target leads. This can help determine what subject lines and body content produce the best
   click-through rates, before sending a final version to the remaining leads.

   To do so, open the :guilabel:`A/B Tests` tab on the mailing form and check the box next to
   :guilabel:`Allow A/B Testing`. Then, adjust the parameters as needed, and click :guilabel:`Create
   an Alternative Version`.

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-ab-testing
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New ‣ A/B Tests tab
      :shows: The A/B Tests tab with Allow A/B Testing enabled, the percentage of recipients and the winner selection criteria.

.. _email_marketing/select_lost_reasons:

Select appropriate lost reasons
===============================

When a lead is marked as lost, Odoo recommends selecting a *Lost Reason* to indicate why the
opportunity did not result in a sale. Doing so keeps the pipeline organized and reporting data
accurate, and generates potential to follow up with the lead in the future.

If an existing *Lost Reason* is not applicable, users with the necessary permissions can create new
ones, which means the lost reasons in a database can vary from organization to organization, and
from pipeline to pipeline.

For more information on *Lost Reasons*, including the creation of them, refer to
:doc:`../../sales/crm/pipeline/lost_opportunities`.

By default, Odoo includes a few common *Lost Reasons*, such as:

- *Too expensive*
- *We don't have people/skills*
- *Not enough stock*

When determining which reasons to include in a lost leads reactivation email, consider what the
email is advertising, in order pinpoint one or more relevant lost reasons. Then, add a rule stating,
:guilabel:`Lost Reason` *does not contain* `_____` for every reason in the database, **except** for
the relevant one(s).

.. example::
   If the email advertises a selection of previously-limited merchandise that is now back in stock,
   it makes sense to target leads with the lost reason: *not enough stock*.

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-out-of-stock
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
      :shows: A set of filter rules that exclude every lost reason except 'Out of stock'.

      :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
      :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

   If the email advertises a price reduction, it makes sense to target leads with the lost reason:
   *too expensive*.

   .. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-too-expensive
      :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ New
      :shows: A set of filter rules that exclude every lost reason except 'Too expensive'.

      :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

Analyze the results
===================

After sending a lost leads reactivation email, marketing teams can use the smart buttons along the
top of the email to analyze the results, and determine follow-up actions.

Clicking on any of the smart buttons opens a list of records matching that button's specific
criteria.

.. screenshot:: email-marketing-lost-leads-email-smart-buttons
   :menu: Email Marketing ‣ Mailings ‣ (sent mailing)
   :shows: A sent lost-leads mailing with its smart buttons and, next to them, the CRM smart buttons for the leads it revived.
   :highlight: The smart button row (red frame).
   :data: Mailing sent to about 30 lost leads.
   :module: mass_mailing, mass_mailing_crm
   :notes: English UI, light theme, 1440px width.

The smart buttons include:

- :guilabel:`Sent`: total number of emails sent.
- :guilabel:`Opened`: percentage of recipients that opened the email.
- :guilabel:`Replied`: percentage of recipients that replied to the email.
- :guilabel:`Clicked`: click-through rate (%) of recipients that clicked on a link in the email.
- :guilabel:`Leads/Opportunities`: number of leads (or opportunities) that have been created in the
  *CRM* pipeline, as a result of the email campaign.
- :guilabel:`Quotations`: number of quotations that have been created in the *Sales* application, as
  a result of the email.
- :guilabel:`Invoiced`: total revenues generated, as a result of the email campaign, via invoices
  sent to, and paid by, customers. These values are recorded in either the *Invoicing* or
  *Accounting* application, depending on which app is installed in the database.
- :guilabel:`Received`: percentage of recipients that received the email.
- :guilabel:`Bounced`: percentage of emails that bounced (:dfn:`not delivered`).
- :guilabel:`Ignored`: the number of recipients that received the email, but have not interacted
  with it in a meaningful way (i.e. opened, clicked, etc.).

Email nurturing
===============

*Email nurturing* (sometimes referred to as *lead nurturing*) is the process of sending a series of
timely and relevant "nudge" emails to connect with a lead, build a deeper relationship, and
ultimately convert the lead into a sale.

The point of nurturing is to keep the email campaign "visible" or at the top of a lead's inbox,
until they are ready to buy.

There are many approaches to effective lead nurturing, but they often involve:

- Sending an initial email (such as, a lost leads reactivation email).
- Sending a follow-up email each week (or according to specific triggers) for the duration of the
  campaign.
- Continuously analyzing results to learn what approaches have resulted in sales.
- Continuously adjusting the approach to remain "visible" at the top of the lead's inbox, and
  hopefully, get a meaningful response from the lead.

As a campaign progresses, a marketing team may send different follow-up emails depending on how a
lead responded the previous week.

.. example::
   A marketing team wants to advertise a restocking of limited-run merchandise to all leads with a
   lost reason of *not enough stock*. They develop the following three-week long lead nurturing
   campaign.

   - **Week 1:** the marketing team sends an initial email, with the subject line: *“Limited run
     merchandise is back in stock! Act now!”*
   - **Week 2:** the marketing team sends two different emails, depending on how a lead responded.

     - If a lead ignored the Week 1 email: *“Stock is almost out, did you get yours?”*
     - If a lead clicked on the Week 1 email: *"You still have time to add this to your collection"*

   - **Week 3:** the marketing team sends a final email to all leads who have not been converted
     stating: *“20% off, don't miss your last chance to get these items before they're gone!”*

   Throughout the campaign, the marketing team continuously refers to the smart buttons along the
   top of the mailing page to see what percentages of leads are opening, clicking on, or ignoring
   the emails. They also regularly analyze reports on how many opportunities, quotations, and
   invoices have been generated by the campaign.
